        Each trade is one realized-P&amp;L event. Depending on the platform Blotterbook auto-detects, that's either one row per closed
        position (close-event exports like TradingView) or entry/exit fills paired into round-trips by a FIFO matcher (which also recovers
        hold time). A fill that closes lots opened at different times books one trade per matched lot, so the trade count can exceed your
        platform's order count; positions still open at the end of a fills export aren't imported. TradingView is verified; the other eight
        adapters are beta — verify the parsed numbers against your statement.

        Timestamps are read as written, in the export's own clock — no timezone conversion. Dates parse as US <b class="text-foreground"

        (RTH/ETH) classification assumes US Eastern time. Export in a US/ET format, or verify the parsed dates before trusting
        day/week/month grouping.

        Commissions apply your selected broker's per-side rate plus the CME exchange/clearing/NFA fee for each contract root, charged per
        round-turn contract (2 sides × qty). Platform + data-feed subscriptions accrue over every calendar month spanned by your trades
        (inclusive), not just the months you traded. All figures are editable snapshot estimates — confirm against your broker's live
        schedule.

        Take-home applies a simplified Section 1256 blended federal rate (60/40 long/short-term) plus your selected state's top marginal
        rate to net-of-cost profit; losses are not carried and tax on a losing period is zero. Note the base is net of subscriptions as a
        simplification — subscriptions don't actually reduce a §1256 gain for a non-trader-tax-status filer, so the estimate can understate
        tax slightly. This is a rough planning estimate, not tax advice — consult a professional for your actual liability. Sharpe uses
        daily-P&amp;L dispersion and is not annualized; small per-weekday samples are noisy.
