# CLAUDE.md

Operational guide for working in this repo. Product overview is in
[`README.md`](README.md); the deep architecture / promotion / versioning
narrative is in [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md); the
accounts/payments/admin backend is in
[`functions/README.md`](functions/README.md).

## What this is

**Blotterbook** is a client-side trading journal and cost dashboard for futures
traders. It parses a balance-history CSV (TradingView and other platforms)
entirely in the browser, stores it locally in IndexedDB, and renders
performance / calendar / cost / tax / stats views. **No trade data ever leaves
the browser.** It's a Vite-built Svelte 5 SPA (ADR-001) that deploys to
Cloudflare Pages (build → `dist/`) plus `/functions/*` edge functions.

## Hard constraints (do not break these)

Blotterbook is a conventional modern **Svelte 5 (runes) + Tailwind v4 + shadcn-svelte** app
built with Vite (ADR-001) and shipped to Cloudflare Pages. The old "pillars" (local-compute-only
moat, dependency minimalism, `tokens.css` as the single token source) have been retired by the
decision owner — pull in dependencies that earn their weight and use the standard tooling. A few
genuine invariants remain:

- **Must be served over http(s).** The app `fetch()`es `/data/*.json`, so opening
  files from disk breaks it. Use a static server.
- **CSP `style-src 'self'` holds — no inline `style=""`.** Tailwind utilities ship as a linked
  stylesheet of classes (`class="bg-card"`), never an inline `style=""` attribute; bits-ui /
  Floating-UI position popups via `element.style` in JS (CSSOM — not gated by `style-src`). The
  invariant is unchanged: **never add a literal `style=""` attribute to markup** — use utilities or
  the `styleProps` action for dynamic styling.
- **Demo never mutates or persists** — it mounts the in-memory `DemoStore` (nothing reaches
  IndexedDB/localStorage by construction) and disables/guards every write path.
- **The committed HTML and data manifest are generated artifacts** that must stay in sync with
  their sources — CI's drift gate fails if they drift (see Commands).
- **The pure-logic core (`src/lib/core/`) is framework-agnostic** and reused as-is by the app and
  the info site; edit persisted data only through the `Store` interface, never `indexedDB` directly.

The app uses the standard Svelte/Vite stack: see
[`docs/adr-001-vite-svelte-spa.md`](docs/adr-001-vite-svelte-spa.md) (the Vite + Svelte SPA),
[`docs/adr-002-tailwind-shadcn.md`](docs/adr-002-tailwind-shadcn.md) (the Tailwind + shadcn-svelte
re-platform), and [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md).
- **The `/app/` surface is a Svelte 5 SPA** (ADR-001; A26 Vite, A27 staging, A33 cutover). All three
  surfaces — `app/app.html`, `app/demo.html`, `app/staging.html` — are hand-authored, marker-free
  mount points (`<div id="app">` + `<script type="module" src="./main.ts">`, body
  `data-mode="app|demo|staging"`). The Svelte app lives in `src/app/`: the redesigned sidebar-shell
  `App.svelte` (an `AppShell` + hash router) + `screens/` (Dashboard/Calendar/Analytics/Blotter/
  CsvLibrary/TradeEditor/Reports) + `parts/` (CostSetup/Onboarding/ActivityTerminal/Definitions/
  StatusBanner) + `lib/{dashboard.svelte.ts,actions,files,flags,nav,analytics,reports}`. It reuses the
  **pure-logic core** in `src/lib/core/` (A29, native TS per A61): `adapters` / `compute`+`costModel`
  in `core` / `store` / `sampledata` / `demostore` / `curveseries` / `report`, with `format` shared by
  the app *and* the info pages. Cross-component state is Svelte runes (`$state`/`$derived`), not a
  shared globals object. The mode-aware store seam (context `'bb:store'`) picks the real IndexedDB
  `Store` (app/staging) or the in-memory `DemoStore` (demo, so **demo persists nothing** — by
  construction). `main.ts` mounts this ONE mode-aware `App.svelte` on every surface — mode is derived
  internally from `PAGE_MODE` (`isDemo`/`isStaging`), there is no per-surface root.
  *(The former vanilla view layer — render/ui/widgets/datamanager/export/main/state.js +
  `partials/app-*.html` — was deleted in A33; the CH16 cutover then retired the pre-redesign
  `App.svelte` + its entire `src/app/components/*` view layer and the `lib/modules.ts` module
  registry, renaming the redesigned `StagingApp.svelte` → `App.svelte` as the sole root.)*

## Commands

```bash
# One-time: install pinned deps (Vite + dev tooling) from the lockfile
npm ci

# Build the deploy artifact (ADR-001/A26; A30 src/+static split; A69 site→Svelte SSG). Emits dist/.
npm run build                    # build-manifest + vite build (root:src, publicDir:static; site pages prerendered) → dist/
npm run dev                      # Vite dev server (HMR) for local development
npm run preview                  # serve the built dist/ locally (production-like)

# Tests / lint (the CI suite — run before pushing)
npm test                         # = lint + typecheck + format:check + test:unit
npm run test:unit                # the 8 node suites: adapters / auth / version / flags / tax / demostore / curveandreport / compute
npm run lint                     # ESLint (flat config; .ts skipped — typechecked instead, A79)
npm run typecheck                # tsc (src/lib/**/*.ts except src/lib/components) + tsc(functions) + svelte-check (src/app + src/site + src/lib/components) — A61
npm run test:e2e                 # Playwright render tests — BUILDS then serves dist/, boots every surface
npm run format                   # Prettier
# (the node suites still run standalone too, e.g. `node scripts/test-adapters.mjs`)

# Build sub-step (idempotent; commit its output — it writes a COMMITTED source, not dist/)
node scripts/build-manifest.mjs  # regenerate static/data/manifest.json content hashes (cache-busting)
# (build-includes.mjs retired by A69 — the nav/footer partials became Nav/Footer.svelte; the site
#  pages are prerendered to static HTML at build time by scripts/vite-ssg.mjs. copy-static.mjs retired by A30.)
```

> **Deploy artifact = `dist/` (gitignored), built by Vite (ADR-001/A26).** The repo root is no

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs `npm ci` → lint → typecheck → format → the unit/logic
tests → **the Vite build** → the Playwright render tests (against `dist/`), then re-runs the
manifest build script and **fails if the result differs from what's committed** (the drift gate;
`dist/` is gitignored, so this proves the build-time tooling didn't leave committed sources stale).
So:

- **After editing any `static/data/*.json` →** run `build-manifest.mjs` and commit the
  regenerated `static/data/manifest.json`.
- *(A69 retired the build-includes half of the drift gate: the nav/footer are now `Nav.svelte` /
  `Footer.svelte`, and the site pages are prerendered to static HTML at build time — there is no
  longer any committed HTML generated from partials.)*

## Conventions

- **Never hand-edit `data/versions.json`.** Versioning is automated from commit
  type + changed paths on push to `main` (CH12). See
  [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md#versioning--releases-ch12). Don't
  set `prod` to the staging number.
- **PR titles are conventional commits** and drive the version bump: `feat:` →
  minor, `fix:`/`chore:`/`refactor:` → patch, `feat!:` / `BREAKING CHANGE:` →
  major.
- **App surfaces & their sources (A33; CH16 redesign cutover).** All three — `app/app.html`,
  `app/demo.html`, `app/staging.html` — are hand-authored, marker-free **Svelte mount points** that
  load `src/app/main.ts` and differ only by `<body data-mode="app|demo|staging">`. `main.ts` mounts
  ONE mode-aware root — the redesigned sidebar-shell `App.svelte` (`AppShell` + hash router over
  `src/app/screens/*` + `src/app/parts/*`) — on every surface; mode is derived internally from
  `PAGE_MODE`. Edit the Svelte components in `src/app/` (`App.svelte` + `screens/` + `parts/`), not
  the HTML shells. (The old `partials/app-*.html` single-source shells were deleted in A33; the CH16
  cutover retired the pre-redesign `App.svelte` + its `src/app/components/*` view layer.)
- **Demo must never mutate or persist.** Demo mounts the Svelte app with `data-mode="demo"` → the
  in-memory `DemoStore`, so **nothing reaches IndexedDB or localStorage by construction**. On top of
  that, every data-writing control is `disabled` when `PAGE_MODE === 'demo'` and each write path is
  guarded (`if (isDemo) return;`). When adding a write, confirm both. (e2e asserts no Blotterbook
  IndexedDB is created on demo.)
- **Styling = Tailwind v4 utilities + canonical shadcn-svelte primitives (ADR-002).** The single
  Tailwind entry [`src/styles/tailwind.css`](src/styles/tailwind.css) is also the **single source of
  design-token values** (`tokens.css` is deleted). It defines the canonical shadcn-svelte semantic
  set in `:root` from Blotterbook's palette — `background`/`foreground`/`card`/`popover`/`primary`/
  `secondary`/`muted`/`accent`/`destructive`/`border`/`input`/`ring` + `chart-1..5` — and maps it via
  `@theme inline`. Components use the **semantic utilities**: `bg-background`/`bg-card`/`bg-secondary`,
  `text-foreground`/`text-muted-foreground`, `bg-primary`/`text-primary-foreground`, `border-border`,
  `hover:bg-accent`. **The UI chrome is a greyscale ramp (UI redesign initiative):** `primary` is
  near-white (the "action" treatment), `ring` is mid-grey — there is no brand blue in the chrome;
  shadcn's **`accent`** is the subtle item-hover surface. **Color survives only in the data layer:**
  `destructive` stays red (error / P&L loss) and the trading-domain **`chart-1..5`** are unchanged —
  chart-1 series-blue, chart-2 P&L-up (green), chart-3 take-home (purple), chart-4 warning (amber),
  chart-5 P&L-down (red) — so `text-chart-2` = positive P&L and `text-destructive`/`text-chart-5` =
  negative. Corners are angular (`--radius` 4px). **Type is mono-forward:** self-hosted Geist Mono
  (`@font-face`, variable woff2 in `src/assets/fonts/`, CSP font-src 'self') is the primary UI
  typeface — both `--font-sans` and `--font-mono` resolve to it. `tw-animate-css` supplies animations.
- **UI primitives = canonical shadcn-svelte at `$lib/components/ui/` (ADR-002).** `button`, `badge`,
  `card`, `checkbox`, `input`, `textarea`, `label`, `switch`, `table`, `tabs`, `tooltip`, `breadcrumb`,
  `separator`, `skeleton`, `dialog`, `sheet`, `alert-dialog`, `dropdown-menu`, `popover`, `select` —
  composed over **bits-ui v2** with `data-slot` attrs and `cn` from `$lib/utils`. Use these for dialogs/menus/popovers/selects instead of hand-rolling a11y; you
  **own the source**, so customize them in place. They render canonically (Dialog/menus/popover/select
  **portal to body**). Add/maintain them with the **shadcn-svelte CLI** — `components.json` is wired,
  so `npx shadcn-svelte add <name>` works. **Icons = [`@lucide/svelte`](https://lucide.dev)** (the
  shadcn-standard set; named imports `import { Calendar } from '@lucide/svelte'`, rendered as
  components with a `class` for sizing/color, e.g. `<Calendar class="size-4" />`). A class applied via prop onto a primitive's ROOT element
  doesn't get the parent's Svelte scope hash, so style such elements with utilities (or the primitive),
  not scoped descendant CSS; for a trigger that must keep scoped styling, use bits-ui's `child` snippet
  so the real element stays in your template. Consult the Svelte MCP server + the shadcn-svelte/bits-ui
  docs when touching these. After UI work, grep `src/` for a new `style="` (CSP) and keep the e2e
  specs + `_headers` green. **No Tailwind preflight** ships (tailwind.css imports only theme +
  utilities, not preflight — to avoid resetting the hand-styled app/site), so native form controls
  keep their UA chrome: a raw `<button>` shows a light UA background unless a `bg-*` utility overrides
  it (and a bare `<a>` gets UA blue + underline). The dev/redesign surfaces neutralize both with
  `[data-mode='dev'] button`/`a` resets in tailwind.css; elsewhere, give bare buttons/links explicit
  styling.
- **Marketing/info site = Svelte SSG (A69).** `index/howto/roadmap/changelog/legal/admin.html` are
  hand-authored, marker-free **templates** (head meta + `<div id="app"><!--ssg-outlet--></div>`
  + a client-entry `<script>`). At build time [`vite-ssg.mjs`](scripts/vite-ssg.mjs) server-renders each page
  component (`src/site/components/*.svelte`) into the outlet (static HTML for SEO + first paint), and
  the client entry hydrates it. Edit the **components** (`src/site/components/` + shared
  `src/site/lib/{Nav,Footer,SiteShell}.svelte`), not the HTML shells. NOT behind the app SPA shell
  (ADR-001); no SvelteKit (A62). Keep CSP `style-src 'self'` — no inline `style=""`; use a CSSOM
  action for dynamic styles (A55). admin stays Cloudflare Access–gated + noindex.
- **Edit data through the `Store` interface only** (`src/lib/core/store.ts`) — never touch
  `indexedDB` directly. A future `CloudStore` implements the same interface.
- **The user-facing changelog is hand-curated** in `data/changelog.json` (not raw
  commits). Add an entry when `prod` bumps.

## Svelte MCP server

The official Svelte remote MCP server is wired up in
[`.claude/settings.json`](.claude/settings.json) (`https://mcp.svelte.dev/mcp`). Use its tools when
writing or changing any Svelte code:

- **`list-sections`** — call FIRST to discover the available Svelte 5 docs sections.
- **`get-documentation`** — after `list-sections`, fetch every section relevant to the task before
  writing code.
- **`svelte-autofixer`** — run on ALL Svelte code before presenting it; keep calling until it
  returns no issues/suggestions.
- **`playground-link`** — only when the user explicitly asks, and NEVER for code already written to
  files in this repo.

## UI mockup workflow

Designing/mocking new screens happens **in code**, not a separate design tool. When asked to build or
mock up a screen, **walk through these steps in order and say which step you're on** — don't jump
straight to final code. How the `/dev` sandbox relates to the real app — what's already global (tokens)
vs. preview-only (shell/screens), and the cutover + staging plan — is in
[`docs/ui-redesign.md`](docs/ui-redesign.md).

1. **Token audit.** Tokens live in [`src/styles/tailwind.css`](src/styles/tailwind.css) (Tailwind v4,
   CSS-based — there is no `tailwind.config.js`). **Greyscale UI** (semantic set is a neutral ramp;
   `primary` near-white, `ring` mid-grey), **angular** corners (`--radius` 4px + `sm/md/lg/xl`), and
   **mono-forward** type (self-hosted Geist Mono; `--font-sans`/`--font-mono` both resolve to it);
   spacing + type scale are Tailwind defaults. **Color lives only in the data layer:** `chart-2` =
   positive P&L (green), `chart-5`/`destructive` = negative (red), `chart-4` = warning (amber),
   `chart-1` series-blue. Use those tokens; never hardcode a raw palette color (`text-green-500`).
   Single dark theme only (no light mode).
2. **App shell.** All mockups sit inside the reusable sidebar frame
   [`src/lib/components/shell/AppShell.svelte`](src/lib/components/shell/AppShell.svelte) — a persistent
   left [`SidebarNav`](src/lib/components/shell/SidebarNav.svelte) (collapsible on desktop, slide-over
   drawer on mobile) + a content column (slim topbar with the sidebar toggle + page `title` + `actions`
   snippet, then scrollable `children`). Props: `brand`/`brandHref` (defaults `Blotterbook` → `/`),
   data-driven `sections` (`NavSection[]`), `active`, `onnavigate`. Tailwind layout utilities only.
3. **Component reference.** The live styleguide is **`/dev/components.html`** (source
   [`src/dev/Styleguide.svelte`](src/dev/Styleguide.svelte)) — every token + installed shadcn-svelte
   primitive with all variants/sizes. **Keep it updated:** when you `npx shadcn-svelte@latest add
   <name>`, add a section for it here. Dev-only — built + deployed but `noindex` + robots-blocked.
4. **Screen-by-screen.** The redesign is the live app now (CH16 cutover — the old `/dev/app.html`
   RedesignApp preview harness was retired), so build/iterate screens directly in
   [`src/app/screens/`](src/app/screens/) (+ cross-screen pieces in [`src/app/parts/`](src/app/parts/)),
   wired by [`src/app/App.svelte`](src/app/App.svelte). To see a screen in isolation with sample data,
   use `/app/demo.html` (the in-memory `DemoStore`, seeded). Per screen: (a) rough the layout with
   Tailwind utilities; (b) reach for installed shadcn-svelte components first — check
   `$lib/components/ui/`, suggest `npx shadcn-svelte@latest add <component>` for anything missing; (c)
   drop to raw bits-ui / custom only when shadcn-svelte doesn't cover the pattern, and match the
   existing visual language; (d) iterate via variant/size props + Tailwind `class` overrides, not by
   rewriting components.
5. **Animation deferral.** For early mockups default to Svelte's built-in transitions (`fade`/`fly`/
   `slide` from `svelte/transition`). Flag (and ask if intentional) before pulling in any heavier
   motion tooling while layouts are still settling.
6. **Consistency pass.** Periodically check new screens against the tokens + the styleguide for drift:
   hardcoded colors, one-off spacing, or a custom component that should have been shadcn-svelte.

## Frontend conventions (Svelte 5 / TS / JSDoc)

This is a Svelte 5 SPA in TypeScript built with Vite — **not SvelteKit** (A62). The repo already
conforms to the rules below; keep it that way.

- **Svelte 5 runes only.** Props are `$props()` (never `export let`); reactive state is `$state()`
  (never a bare `let`); derived values are `$derived()` (never `$:`); side effects are `$effect()`
  (never `$:` blocks). Don't introduce `createEventDispatcher` — use callback props. Cross-component
  state here is Svelte **runes + `context('bb:store')`**, not a globals object or `svelte/store`
  writables; a shared-reactive-state module would be a `.svelte.ts` file, but none exist today.
- **File extensions.** Components with a template → `.svelte` (all carry `<script lang="ts">`, A61);
  shared reactive-state-with-runes modules → `.svelte.ts`; pure logic / utilities / API calls /
  types → `.ts`. No hand-written `.js` in `src/` (the pure-logic core is native TS — A61).
- **TypeScript.** `src/` is `any`-free — keep it that way: prefer proper types or `unknown`, and put
  shared interfaces in [`src/lib/core/types.ts`](src/lib/core/types.ts), not inline. Type
  fetched/persisted JSON at the boundary rather than reaching for `any` (e.g. the `Stored*`
  persistence shapes in `types.ts`, or page-local interfaces like the backlog/status shapes in
  `src/site/components/Admin.svelte`).
- **JSDoc.** Don't restate types in JSDoc (`@param {type}`/`@returns {type}`) — tsc owns that.
  JSDoc is for prose on non-obvious behavior, `@deprecated`, and `@example`; skip it entirely when
  the name + types are self-evident.

> **Caveat vs. the generic "Svelte 5 SPA" template:** this repo is a **multi-page** Vite build, so a
> few one-size-fits-all conventions don't apply literally. The Vite config is the multi-page
> [`vite.config.mjs`](vite.config.mjs) (10 HTML entries + the [`vite-ssg.mjs`](scripts/vite-ssg.mjs) plugin),
> **not** a 4-line `vite.config.ts`. SPA routing lives in [`static/_redirects`](static/_redirects)
> (Vite's `publicDir` is `static/`, **there is no `public/`**) and rewrites `/app/` → `/app/app.html`
> — a `/* /index.html 200` catch-all would break the marketing pages and the demo/staging surfaces.
> The source layout is `src/{lib,app,site}` (see **Repo layout** below), not `src/{components,pages,
> state}`.

## Repo layout

> **Vite builds `src/` → `dist/` (ADR-001/A26; source-tree reorg A30); Pages serves `dist/`.** The
> Vite **root is `src/`** (everything bundled/served) and **`static/` is the `publicDir`** (copied
> verbatim to the `dist/` root — this retired `scripts/copy-static.mjs`). `functions/`, `scripts/`,
> and tooling stay at the **repo root**, unserved (`partials/` retired by A69). **URLs are preserved 1:1**: each HTML
> entry's path *relative to `src/`* maps to its URL (`src/index.html` → `/`, `src/app/app.html` →
> `/app/app.html`), and `static/` mirrors to the root (`static/data` → `/data`, `static/_headers` →
> `/_headers`, `static/assets/og-image.png` → `/assets/og-image.png`). Source paths are **decoupled**
> from URLs (guardrail **A18 retired** — superseded by A26 + A30). Renaming/moving a browser-served
> file still changes its URL and must be kept in lockstep across `static/_redirects`,
> `static/_headers`, `static/robots.txt`, `static/sitemap.xml` + page canonicals, the absolute
> `/app//assets//data/` refs, `vite.config` (`root`/`publicDir`/`outDir`/`rollupOptions.input` +
> the `ssg()` page list), and the `build-manifest`/`bump-version` path assumptions. See

## Data flow

```
loadRefData()   manifest.json → brokers/exchange-fees/feeds/state-tax (cache-busted by hash)
CSV text
  → Adapters.detect()  sniff header → platform
  → Adapters.parse()   platform adapter → normalized trades (fills go through pairFills())
  → Store.addTrades / getAllTrades   delta-merge + persist (IndexedDB)
  → applyFilters()  active filter set → working trade list
  → compute()       trades → metrics (PnL, win rate, drawdown, curve, expectancy, …)
  → costModel()     metrics + setup inputs → commissions, subscriptions, tax, take-home
  → Svelte app      → reactive components render cards / curve / calendar / advanced / break-even
```

The compute pipeline (`adapters`/`compute`/`costModel`) is the **pure-logic core**, reused
verbatim (A29). The Svelte app drives it: reactive state lives in runes (`$state`/`$derived`)
inside the components, the active `Store` is provided via `context('bb:store')` (real IndexedDB
for app/staging, in-memory `DemoStore` for demo), and `PAGE_MODE` (with `isDemo`/`isStaging` locals
derived from it) adapts per surface. Boot: `loadRefData()` → `Store.init()` → `restoreSession()`
(app seeds nothing → empty state shows first-run onboarding; demo seeds in-memory; staging seeds its
DB first) → `mount()`.

The `core.ts` event bus survives the cutover (emitters re-wired in A151 — the CH16 cutover had
dropped them all): `loadRefData` emits `refdata:loaded`, and the shared dashboard actions fire
`app:ready`, `data:loaded`, `data:imported`, `note:saved`, `trade:deleted`, `backup:created`,
`data:erased` over an `EventTarget` for any listener (the Dashboard's ActivityTerminal subscribes).
The bus is a no-op with no subscriber.

## Adding things

- **A platform adapter:** one object in `src/lib/core/adapters.ts` (`sniff` + `toTrades`)
  plus a fixture in `scripts/test-adapters.mjs`. Every adapter normalizes to the
  same trade shape `{ time, date, pnl, symbol, root, side[, qty, entryTime,
  exitTime, holdMs] }` so `compute()`/`costModel()` never change.
- **A rate change:** edit the relevant `data/*.json`, then run
  `build-manifest.mjs`. No app code changes.
- **A new feature:** add/extend a Svelte screen/part in `src/app/`; it ships to all three
  surfaces at once (no promotion step since the A33 cutover). Gate per surface in the component
  (`PAGE_MODE`/`isDemo`/`isStaging`) and keep demo non-mutating. See the checklist in
  [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md#building-a-feature-all-surfaces-share-one-spa).

## Deployment

Cloudflare Pages: `npm run build` emits `dist/` (Vite) and Pages serves it; `/functions/*` are
edge functions automatically. Build command `npm run build`, output dir `dist` (ADR-001/A26).
