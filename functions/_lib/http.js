/* Lightweight fixed-window rate limiter backed by STATUS_KV (defense-in-depth on the
   admin endpoints — they're already behind Access + a token). Keyed by Access email or
   client IP. Best-effort: KV isn't atomic and is eventually consistent, so this throttles
   abuse rather than enforcing an exact quota. Fails OPEN if KV isn't bound (returns false)
   so a missing binding can't lock the admin out. Returns true when the caller is over the
   limit and should be rejected with 429.

   GUARDRAIL (S22): because this fails OPEN and is best-effort, an endpoint's security must
   NEVER depend on it — auth (Cloudflare Access JWT + constant-time token/key compare) is the
   real control; rate-limiting is only defense-in-depth. Do not add a public/high-traffic
   endpoint that relies on rateLimited() as its primary protection, and keep STATUS_KV bound
   in prod so the throttle is actually active (it silently disappears when KV is unbound). */
