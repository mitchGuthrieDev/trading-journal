# Blotterbook — architecture & contributing

The long-form "how and why" for Blotterbook's internals. Start with
[`README.md`](../README.md) for the product, and [`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md) for
the quick operational reference (commands, conventions, file map). This document
is the deep-dive that `CLAUDE.md` points at.

The internal shorthand you'll see throughout the codebase and backlog (A2, CH12,
CH16, F13, F14, S19, R1, …) are backlog item ids from
[`data/backlog.json`](../data/backlog.json) — kept here for traceability.

## Design pillars

Three intentional constraints shape every decision:

1. **Compute happens locally** — all parsing, metrics, and storage are
   client-side; no trade data leaves the browser.
2. **No runtime dependencies** *(hard rule)* — the shipped app loads no framework
   and no third-party/runtime libraries; it's plain JavaScript. Build-*time*
   tooling is a separate, open question (see the "adopt a build" discussion,
   **R19**) — "no build" is no longer an absolute, only the *shipped* output must
   stay dependency-free.
3. **Deployable as static files with zero runtime deps** — ships to Cloudflare
   Pages as static assets, with `/functions/*` as the thin edge layer for the few
   things that can't be client-side. No build is *required* to deploy today (the
   committed files are the artifacts) — a soft convention now under review
   (**R19**), not a hard pillar like #2.

Because the app is split across files (it used to be one `index.html`), it must
be **served over http(s)** — opening from disk blocks the `fetch()` of the
reference data.

## Repository layout & the deploy contract

**There is no build step, so the repo root *is* the Cloudflare Pages web root —
a file's path *is* its public URL.** Pages serves the committed tree as-is
(`build-manifest.mjs` is only a "recommended build command" that regenerates a
file in place; the deploy works without it). This one fact makes the folder
layout simultaneously the **URL structure** and the **deploy contract**, and it's
why the root is deliberately flat rather than split into `src/`+`public/`.

**Pinned at the deploy root** (Cloudflare Pages requires it — these cannot move):

- `functions/` — Pages Functions are resolved from the project root.
- `_headers`, `_redirects` — must sit at the output root to take effect.
- `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`, the favicon, and the pages that serve at `/…`
  (`index.html`, `howto.html`, `roadmap.html`, `changelog.html`, `legal.html`,
  `admin.html`).

**Consequence — moving any browser-served file changes its URL, and the path is
hard-coded in ~6 places that must be updated in lockstep.** Before relocating
anything under `app/`, `assets/`, or `data/` (or renaming a root page), update
*all* of:

| Coupling point | What it hard-codes |
| --- | --- |
| Absolute URL references in HTML/JS | `~23` `/app/…`, `~19` `/assets/…`, plus `/data/*.json` and `/api/*` `fetch()`es |
| `_redirects` | `/app/ → /app/app.html` rewrite |
| `_headers` | CSP `connect-src 'self'` assumes same-origin `/api`, `/data`, `/app` |
| `robots.txt` / `sitemap.xml` | `/app/`, `/admin.html`, and the public-page canonical URLs (CH5/CH6) |
| Page `<link rel="canonical">` + OG tags | the canonical URL of each marketing page (CH5) |
| `scripts/build-includes.mjs` | scans `['.', 'app']` for `*.html`; reads `partials/` |
| `scripts/build-manifest.mjs` | hashes `data/*.json`, with an explicit filename exclude-set |
| `scripts/bump-version.mjs` | classifies prod-shipping surfaces by the `app/`, `partials/`, `assets/`, `data/` prefixes + specific filenames |

**Do not** reorganize into `src/`+`public/` with a bundler — that requires a
build step, which violates design pillar #2. If a reorg is ever genuinely
warranted, the only Pages-compatible move is a **`public/` output-directory
split** (browser-served files under `public/`, Pages "build output directory" set
to `public`, with `functions/` + `scripts/` + `partials/` + tooling staying at
the repo root). URLs stay identical, but `_headers`/`_redirects` relocate into
`public/` and every path prefix in the table above changes — so it's an
all-at-once migration, not a piecemeal one. (Tracked as guardrail **A18**.)

## Architecture & data flow

The data flow is linear and entirely client-side:

```
loadRefData()   manifest.json → brokers/exchange-fees/feeds/state-tax (cache-busted by hash)
CSV text
  → Adapters.detect()  sniff header → platform
  → Adapters.parse()   platform adapter → normalized trades (fills go through pairFills())
                       → [{time,date,pnl,symbol,root,side[,qty,entry/exit,holdMs]}]
  → Store.addTrades / getAllTrades   delta-merge + persist (IndexedDB)
  → applyFilters()  active filter set → working trade list
  → compute()       trades → metrics (PnL, win rate, drawdown, curve, days, expectancy, …)
  → costModel()     metrics + Setup inputs → commissions, subscriptions, tax, take-home
  → render*()       → cards / curve / calendar / advanced / break-even
```

`app/app.css` and the app scripts are shared by `app.html`, `demo.html`, and
`staging.html`, all adapting via `document.body.dataset.mode` (`PAGE_MODE`).
**Demo** (`data-mode="demo"`) is in-memory and never persists; **Staging**
(`data-mode="staging"`, `STAGING_PAGE`) uses an isolated IndexedDB and seeds the
sample dataset.

Key globals: `TRADES`, `METRICS_ALL`, `FILTERS`, `SCOPE`, `calYear`/`calMonth`,
`selectedDate`, `JOURNAL_DATES`, `TRADE_META`, `SAVED_FILTERS`, `DEMO_MODE`,
`PAGE_MODE`/`STAGING_PAGE`. Boot: `loadRefData()` → `Store.init()` →
`restoreSession()` (demo runs `runDemo()`; staging seeds its DB first).

The former monolithic `app.js` is split (A2) into ordered, concern-scoped classic
scripts — **core → render → data → ui → export → datamanager → widgets → main** —
loaded in that sequence. They're plain `<script>`s sharing one global scope, not
ES modules: `main.js` (loaded last) holds all event wiring + the boot IIFE, so
every function/state it calls is already defined. No bundler, no build step.

The activity terminal, session pill, and workspace templates live in
`app/widgets.js` (loaded on every app page since CH16). Shared code never names a
widget symbol — instead `core.js` exposes a tiny event bus (`emit`/`onEvent` over
an `EventTarget`), and shared actions fire events (`app:ready`, `data:loaded`,
`data:imported`, `note:saved`, `trade:deleted`, `backup:created`, `data:erased`)
that `widgets.js` subscribes to. The bus stays a no-op when a page has no subscriber,
so the decoupling holds even as surfaces diverge.

## Shared chrome: tokens + partials (no bundler)

To keep the static, build-stepless deploy while killing copy-paste drift, two
things are single-sourced:

- **Design tokens** live only in [`tokens.css`](../tokens.css). `site.css` and
  `app/app.css` `@import` it; the bespoke homepage links it directly. Change a
  color or font in one place.
- **Shared HTML lives in `partials/`** and
  [`scripts/build-includes.mjs`](../scripts/build-includes.mjs) assembles two
  things from it:
  1. The **info-site nav + footer**
     ([`partials/nav.html`](../partials/nav.html) /
     [`partials/footer.html`](../partials/footer.html)) injected into each info
     page via `<!-- include:nav active=… -->` / `<!-- include:footer -->` markers
     (`active=KEY` highlights the matching `data-nav` link).
  2. The **three app surfaces** — `app/{app,demo,staging}.html` are generated
     from the `partials/app-*.html` fragments, with
     `<!--IF mode=app|demo|staging-->` / `<!--IF mode!=demo-->` conditionals
     selecting the per-surface markup from one source (this is how a control gets
     `disabled` on demo or a panel ships staging-only).

It's **idempotent** — re-run it after editing any partial:
`node scripts/build-includes.mjs`. The committed HTML already contains the
rendered output, so the deploy works with or without running it. The **homepage
and admin keep their own bespoke nav/footer** by design — they only share the
tokens.

## Input: the CSV

Blotterbook reads CSV exports from a trading **platform** and **auto-detects** the
format. The flow is two-step so a bad file never silently corrupts your data:

1. **Load CSV** → the file is parsed and the platform is detected (overridable
   from the **Platform** dropdown). A status line confirms what was found (e.g.
   *Detected TradingView · 63 trades ready*) or explains the problem.
2. **Start Blotterbook** (landing) or **Import** (Manage data) commits the parsed
   trades.

Only `.csv` files are accepted, and nothing loads until a parse succeeds.

The reference format is the **TradingView** "List of trades" export — required
columns (matched case-insensitively by substring): **`Time`**, **`Realized PnL
(value)`** (falls back to `Realized PnL`), and **`Action`**. Each row is one trade
— a position-*close* event with its own realized PnL; the instrument comes from
the `Action` text and reduces to a **root ticker** (`MESM2025` → `MES`,
`MES1!` → `MES`, `M2KZ2025` → `M2K`).

```
Time,Action,Realized PnL (value)
2026-06-02 10:00:00,"Close long position for symbol MESM2025 at price 5300.00",75.00
```

**Re-uploads merge.** Each trade gets a stable id from its
`time + symbol + side + pnl`. Uploading a CSV that overlaps a previous one only
inserts the genuinely new rows, so you can export a wider window each time without
creating duplicates. The data summary shows `+N new · M dup`.

## Platform adapters & auto-detection

Parsing is keyed to the trading **platform** the CSV came from (TradingView,
Tradovate, …) — **not** the broker. The two are independent: you might clear
through **AMP** but export from **TradingView**. The Broker dropdown only drives
the cost model; the Platform dropdown (and the detector) drives parsing.
`app/adapters.js` is a small registry — `window.Adapters` — with:

- **`detect(text)`** — sniffs the header row against each adapter's signature
  columns and returns the best match (e.g. Tradovate has `B/S` + `Contract`;
  Rithmic has `Buy/Sell` + `Qty Filled`; IBKR has `DateTime` + `Buy/Sell` +
  `Proceeds`). No match → the user picks the platform manually.
- **`parse(text, platformId?)`** — runs the chosen (or detected) adapter and
  returns `{ ok, trades, platform, label, beta, … }` or `{ ok:false, error }`.

Every adapter **normalizes to the same internal trade shape** — `{ time, date,
pnl, symbol, root, side[, qty, entryTime, exitTime, holdMs] }` — so `compute()` /
`costModel()` never change. Two export styles are handled:

- **Closed positions** — each row is a finished trade with realized PnL
  (**TradingView**, **MotiveWave**).
- **Fills** — individual buy/sell executions. A FIFO **round-trip matcher**
  (`pairFills()`) pairs entries→exits per symbol to build closed trades — and that
  finally unlocks **hold time** (*Avg Hold Time* in Advanced Statistics). When a
  fills export carries realized PnL per closing row (IBKR), it's used directly;
  otherwise PnL is computed from price × a built-in futures **point-value** map
  (unknown roots default to ×1, correct for equities).

Supported platforms: **TradingView** (verified), plus **Tradovate, Rithmic
R\|Trader, Sierra Chart, TradeStation, MotiveWave, Webull, Interactive Brokers,
Schwab/thinkorswim** — these are `beta`, built from documented formats and
exercised by `scripts/test-adapters.cjs` with synthetic samples. They're flagged
*(beta — verify the numbers)* in the UI until validated against a real export.
**Adding a platform** = one object in `adapters.js` (`sniff` + `toTrades`) and a
fixture in the test.

## Cost model

Costs are applied to whatever scope **and filters** are active.

**Commissions (per symbol, broker-aware):**

```
all-in per side = broker commission (micro|standard tier) + CME exchange/clearing/NFA fee
round-turn per trade = 2 × all-in per side          (one entry + one exit, 1 contract)
```

The broker commission comes from `brokers.json`; the exchange fee from
`exchange-fees.json`. A symbol's tier (micro vs. standard) is from that file's
`micro` list, falling back to a heuristic (`M`-prefixed roots are treated as
micros). Unknown symbols use a fallback and are flagged `*`.

**Subscriptions (not prorated):** `platform fee + data-feed fee` is charged as a
**full month for every distinct calendar month** present in the active scope —
never prorated by day.

**Tax (Section 1256, estimated):**

```
blended rate = ltcgWeight × ltcg + ordinaryWeight × fedOrdinary + state top marginal rate
            = 0.60 × 15%  + 0.40 × 24% + state rate            (defaults, from state-tax.json)
```

Applied to net pre-tax profit **only when positive**. A rough planning estimate,
not tax advice.

**Break-even per trade:** `(total commissions + subscriptions) ÷ trade count`.

## Reference data (JSON) + cache-busting

The broker/fee/feed/state tables live in `/data/*.json` and are fetched at runtime
by `loadRefData()` before anything renders. Edit a JSON file to change rates — no
app code changes. Brokers modeled: **AMP, EdgeClear, Tradovate / NinjaTrader,
Optimus, Charles Schwab (thinkorswim), Interactive Brokers, TradeStation,
TradingView PaperTrade** (zero commission).

| File | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `brokers.json` | `order` + `brokers` (per-side commission for `micro`/`std`). |
| `exchange-fees.json` | `exchange` (fee per root), `micro` set, and a `fallback`. |
| `feeds.json` | `shared` feed sets + `brokerFeeds` (a broker may alias a shared set by name, e.g. `"AMP": "CQG"`). |
| `state-tax.json` | `model` (`fedOrdinary`, `ltcg`, weights) + `states` (`[abbr, ratePct, label]`). |

### `schemaVersion` + content-hash cache-busting

Every data file carries a **`schemaVersion`** field, and
`scripts/build-manifest.mjs` writes `data/manifest.json` mapping each file to a
short SHA-256 **content hash**. At boot the app fetches `manifest.json` with
`no-cache`, then requests each data file as `brokers.json?v=<hash>`.

- **Aggressive caching with instant updates.** Because the URL only changes when
  the file's bytes change, the data files can be cached forever by the browser and
  Cloudflare's edge — yet an edit takes effect immediately (new bytes → new hash →
  new URL → cache miss).
- **`schemaVersion` is the contract.** The hash answers *"did these bytes
  change?"*; the version answers *"did the **shape** change?"*. If a file's
  structure changes incompatibly, bump its `schemaVersion` so the app can detect a
  too-new/too-old file and refuse to misread it.

**After editing any data file, run:** `node scripts/build-manifest.mjs`.

## Local persistence

Trade data and day-notes are stored in **IndexedDB** via `app/store.js`. Nothing
is uploaded.

- **Stores:** `trades` (keyed by the dedupe id), `journal` (per-day notes keyed by
  date — each a `{text, tags, shots}` annotation), `meta` (setup + saved filters),
  and `trademeta` (per-trade tags/note/screenshots, keyed by trade id; added in DB
  v2).
- **Delta merge:** `Store.addTrades()` skips ids already present, so re-imports
  only add new trades.
- **Demo data is never persisted** — it lives in memory only.
- **Erase all local data** (Manage data → Danger zone) calls `Store.purge()` to
  wipe all four stores after a confirm.

The app never touches `indexedDB` directly — it goes through the `Store`
interface. A future cloud backend implements the same interface, so adding cloud
sync won't touch the rest of the app. The manager added `deleteTrade`,
`getAllJournal`, `deleteJournal`, `getAllMeta`,
`getTradeMeta`/`saveTradeMeta`/`deleteTradeMeta`/`allTradeMeta`, `exportAll`, and
`importAll` to that interface.

Separate, unrelated version numbers are intentionally **not** touched by the
release automation: `store.js` `DB_VERSION` (IndexedDB schema), the backup-file
`version`, and `manifest.json` content hashes.

## Staging sandbox

`app/staging.html` (`body[data-mode="staging"]`) is a **clone of the main app**,
launched from the admin page (**Launch staging env**) to trial changes before they
reach the main app. It uses an **isolated IndexedDB** (`blotterbookStaging`, set in
`store.js`) so testing never touches real data, and **seeds the sample dataset
once** so it opens in the loaded state. It has the full top bar including **Manage
data** and the **Load CSV** landing; notes/tags/filters persist to its own DB.

**Staging is key-gated.** `functions/_middleware.js` gates `/app/staging.html`: it
requires the `ADMIN_KEY` via an `x-admin-key` header or a `bb_staging` cookie (if
`ADMIN_KEY` isn't configured, staging stays open). Browsers can't set request
headers on a navigation, so the admin panel's **Launch staging env** button sets
the short-lived path-scoped `bb_staging` cookie before opening the page — the token
never travels in the URL (S19).

After CH16, `STAGING_PAGE` no longer gates dashboard *features* — those were all
promoted to every surface. It marks only the staging **environment**: the isolated
`blotterbookStaging` DB, the one-time sample seed, the "open on the initial state"
landing, and the **Exit staging** affordance. The promoted widgets live in
`app/widgets.js` (renamed from the old `app/staging.js`), now loaded on every app
page.

## Promoting a feature (staging → prod)

Staging runs ahead of the main app + demo; **promotion** is the deliberate step of
moving a proven feature onto the prod surfaces. The surface a feature ships to is
decided by **where its code lives and how it's gated** — not by one flag you flip.

**The model in one breath.** The **demo mirrors prod 1:1**: every feature the main
app has, the demo has too — just with data-mutating controls **disabled** and
persistence blocked (`DEMO_MODE`). **Staging is a superset** that stays permanently
ahead. The two version tracks in `data/versions.json` are **independent counters**;
a promotion does **not** sync the numbers — it bumps `prod` by the commit-type
level and lets the changelog record "shipped to prod in v`X`".

**Gate layers a feature can hide behind** — promote each that applies:

- **JS in a staging-only file** → move the logic into the relevant shared
  `app/*.js` module, or load the file on every page via
  `partials/app-scripts.html` (as `app/widgets.js` now is).
- **JS in a shared module behind `if(!STAGING_PAGE) return` / `if(STAGING_PAGE)`**
  → remove the runtime guard so the code runs on every surface.
- **HTML inline in `app/staging.html`** → move the markup into the right
  `partials/app-*.html` so all three pages get it.
- **HTML in a partial behind `<!--IF mode=staging-->`** → widen the conditional.

**Promotion checklist** (one feature at a time):

1. **Find every gate.** Grep the feature for `STAGING_PAGE` and `mode=staging` (and
   any inline markup that only `app/staging.html` carries). List each gate layer.
2. **Un-gate the JS** — delete the `STAGING_PAGE` runtime guard (or move a
   staging-only script's logic into a shared `app/*.js` module).
3. **Un-gate the HTML** — move inline staging markup into a partial, or widen the
   partial's `<!--IF mode=staging-->` to the modes it should reach (normally all
   three).
4. **Preserve demo restrictions (never skip).** The feature **must** appear on demo
   — but every data-mutating control needs `disabled` in the `<!--IF mode=demo-->`
   variant **and** a `DEMO_MODE` guard on any write path. Confirm no new write can
   run under `DEMO_MODE`.
5. **Rebuild** — `node scripts/build-includes.mjs` regenerates `app/app.html`,
   `demo.html`, and `staging.html` from the partials; the diff shows exactly what
   each surface gained.
6. **Verify all three surfaces.** App: feature works and persists. Demo: feature
   visible, mutating controls greyed out, nothing saved. Staging: unchanged.
7. **Title the PR `feat:` (or `fix:`)** so CH12 bumps **prod** by the right level.
   Both tracks move and staging keeps its lead — no manual version edit, and never
   hand-set `prod` to the staging number.
8. **Add a changelog entry** for the new prod version in `data/changelog.json`.

## Versioning & releases (CH12)

Versioning is **automated from commits + PR merges**; there's nothing to bump by
hand. Two tracks live in one source of truth, `data/versions.json`:

- **`prod`** — shared by the main app and demo (their header badges both show it).
- **`staging`** — the staging sandbox's own, faster-moving version.

The platform **phase** is *derived*, not stored: while the prod major is `0` the
label reads **Beta `<prod>`** (e.g. `Beta 0.12.0`); at `1.0.0`+ the "Beta" drops.

**How a bump happens.** On every push to `main`, the `Version bump` workflow
(`.github/workflows/version-bump.yml` → `scripts/bump-version.mjs`) reads the merge
commit:

1. **Level** from the conventional-commit type in the squash-merge title — `feat:`
   → minor, `fix:`/`chore:`/`refactor:`/etc → patch, `feat!:` or a `BREAKING
   CHANGE:` footer → major, untyped → patch. (See the `commitConvention` field in
   `data/backlog.json`.)
2. **Which track** from the changed paths — any **prod-shipping** file (shared
   `app/*.js`, `app/app.html`/`demo.html`/`app.css`, `partials/*`, `assets/*`,
   `tokens.css`, `data/*` except versions/backlog json) bumps **both** prod and
   staging; **only** `app/staging.html` bumps staging alone; non-app changes (info
   pages, README, `.github`) bump nothing.

It writes `data/versions.json` and commits it back to `main` as
`chore(release): … [skip ci]` (so it doesn't re-trigger itself). **Requires** the
GitHub Actions bot to be allowed to push to `main`; if the branch is protected the
job logs a warning instead of failing.

**Display is runtime-fetched.** Each page's `.ver` badge is populated at load from
`/data/versions.json` (`assets/util.js`), with the baked literal in
`partials/app-topbar.html` as the offline fallback. The admin panel surfaces the
same values **read-only**.

## Changelog release notes

`changelog.html` → `assets/changelog.js` renders **`data/changelog.json`** (F13): a
curated, version-keyed release-notes file for the **prod** (main + demo) track,
newest first. Each entry has a prod `version`, a `date`, a friendly
`title`/`summary`, and optional `highlights`. Everything before automated
versioning is rolled up into a single `beta: true` "Beta released" entry.

It is **manually curated** — add a new entry at the top of `releases` each time the
prod version bumps. This deliberately replaces the old raw-commit feed so the page
reads as release notes, not a git log. The file is hash-cache-busted by
`build-manifest` like other `data/*.json`; `assets/changelog.js` keeps a tiny
inline fallback for local dev / a failed fetch.

## Admin page & the Live indicator

`admin.html` is an internal control page. It can set the homepage's **Live** pill,
manage **feature flags** (consumed by the app at boot via `/api/config`), show the
**platform versions** read-only, show a read-only **Backlog** view (from
[`data/backlog.json`](../data/backlog.json) — titles/effort/status only, prompts
stay in the file), auto-fill its own admin key, and **launch the staging sandbox**.
The homepage pill reads `/api/status`: a fixed status (**Live** = green,
**Maintenance** = yellow, **Offline** = red) wins; otherwise (**Auto**) it pings
`/app/`. `GET /api/status` and `GET /api/config` are public; all writes are
admin-only.

**Backend setup:** bind a **KV namespace** as `STATUS_KV` to the Pages project, and
set an **`ADMIN_KEY`** secret. Detailed click-paths and the admin-auth model
(short-lived HMAC tokens, Cloudflare Access JWT verification) are in
[`functions/README.md`](../functions/README.md).

### Location-based tax state

`functions/api/geo.js` returns the visitor's coarse region from Cloudflare's edge
metadata (`request.cf`), and the app calls `/api/geo` on the landing screen to
**pre-select the US state** for the tax estimate. No IP or third-party service,
nothing stored; it never overrides a chosen/saved state and silently does nothing
off-Cloudflare or outside the US.

## Marketing & info site

The site root (`index.html`) is a **single-page, scrollable marketing site**,
styled with the same dark palette and tokens as the app. A sticky header carries
anchor links plus links to the standalone info pages. On narrow screens the nav
links collapse behind a **hamburger menu** (a CSS-only checkbox toggle on every
page).

**Standalone info pages** (share `site.css`): `howto.html` (a How-To wiki with a
sticky sidebar — getting-started walkthrough + per-platform import guides),
`roadmap.html` (shipped-vs-planned checklist), `changelog.html` ("Blotterlog"
release notes), and `legal.html` (disclaimers, terms, privacy summary).

## Known limitations

- **Drawdown is realized only** — from the closed-trade curve; no open-position
  heat.
- **Hold time depends on the export** — fills-based imports get hold time from the
  round-trip matcher; closed-position exports like TradingView carry only the close
  timestamp.
- **Beta adapters need real-export validation** — the eight non-TradingView
  adapters are built from documented formats and synthetic tests. Header changes on
  a platform's side can break detection.
- **Fills PnL can approximate** — when a fills export has no realized PnL, it's
  computed from price × a built-in futures point-value map; unrecognized futures
  roots fall back to ×1 (correct for equities, wrong for an unlisted contract until
  added to the map).
- **Commissions are modeled** — raw PnL is gross; rates come from the editable JSON
  and may drift.
- **Calendar-day & session grouping** — both use the literal `Time` value, not the
  CME session day; RTH/ETH assumes the timestamp's clock time.
- **Sharpe is illustrative** — daily PnL, population std, not annualized.
- **Local storage is per-browser** — data is not synced across devices and is
  cleared if you clear site data. Use **Manage data → Download backup** for a
  portable JSON snapshot. (Cloud sync is the planned subscription tier.)
