**Blotterbook** is a private trading journal and cost dashboard for futures traders. You export
your account balance history from TradingView (or another supported platform), drop the CSV into
Blotterbook, and get a full performance, cost, and tax picture — an equity curve, a trading
calendar, commission and subscription breakdowns, a Section 1256 tax estimate, and a journal for
your notes, tags, and screenshots.

The catch is that there is no catch: **your trade data never leaves your browser.** Everything is
parsed, computed, and stored locally. No accounts, no uploads, no tracking.

## Why Blotterbook

- 🔒 **Private by design.** All parsing and computation run in your browser; your trades are saved
  locally in your browser's storage and never sent anywhere. No login, no cookie banner, no
  tracking.
- 💸 **Knows what trading actually costs.** Models broker commissions, exchange/clearing/NFA fees,
  platform + data-feed subscriptions, and a Section 1256 tax estimate — so you see *take-home*, not
  just gross PnL.
- 📈 **The full picture.** Cumulative equity curve, a Sunday-first trading calendar of daily PnL,
  win rate, profit factor, expectancy, drawdown, payoff ratio, streaks, Sharpe/Sortino, and more.
- 📓 **A real journal.** Per-day and per-trade notes, tags, and screenshots; saved filter views; a
  tag filter — so you can actually review *why* a day went the way it did.
- 🔌 **Multi-platform import.** TradingView is fully verified; Tradovate, Rithmic, Sierra Chart,
  TradeStation, MotiveWave, Webull, Interactive Brokers, and Schwab/thinkorswim are supported in
  beta.
- ⚡ **Dependency-free.** No framework, no bundler, no build step. It's static files that load
  instantly.

## Quick start

1. **Open the app.** From the homepage, click **Launch Blotterbook** — or run it locally:

   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8000      # then visit http://localhost:8000/app/app.html
   ```

   (It must be served over http — opening the files from disk won't work, because the app loads its
   reference data over the network.)

2. **Set up costs.** In the **Broker & Costs** panel, pick your **Broker**, **Data feed**, and
   **State**, and set your monthly **Platform fee**.

3. **Export your CSV.** In TradingView, export your account balance history (the "List of trades"
   export) as CSV.

4. **Load it.** Click **Load CSV**, pick the file, then **Start Blotterbook**. Your data is saved
   locally and restored automatically next time. Re-uploads merge — only genuinely new trades are
   added, so you can export a wider window each time without creating duplicates.

**Just want to look around?** Click **See Demo** on the homepage for a generated, profitable
two-year sample dataset (nothing is saved). To clear your data later, use **Manage data → Erase all
local data**.

A step-by-step walkthrough and per-platform import guides live in the in-app **How-To** wiki
(`howto.html`).

## How it works

```
Your CSV ─▶ parsed & platform-detected in the browser
         ─▶ saved locally (IndexedDB) — never uploaded
         ─▶ metrics + cost/tax model computed client-side
         ─▶ rendered: cards · equity curve · calendar · cost waterfall · stats
```

The only network calls Blotterbook ever makes are for its *own* reference data (broker/fee/tax
tables) and an optional coarse-region lookup to pre-fill your tax state — never your trades. The
full privacy statement is on the in-app **Legal** page (`legal.html`).

## Pricing

An **Obsidian-style** model: the app is **free for everyone** and stays free. Support is optional,
and the only planned paid feature is cross-device sync.

| Tier | Price | What | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Blotterbook** | Free | the full app — CSV import, journal, cost/tax model | shipped |
| **Back the project** | $25 one-time *or* $50/year | optional donation that keeps it free & funds features | planned |
| **Synced workspaces** | ~$5/mo | end-to-end-encrypted cross-device sync of trades/notes/tags/filters | planned |

## Documentation

- **[`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md)** — how Blotterbook works under the hood: data
  flow, the platform adapters, the cost/tax model, the staging→prod promotion model, versioning, and
  the no-bundler build system. Start here to contribute.
- **[`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md)** — quick operational reference: commands, the file-by-file map, and
  the conventions to follow when changing the code.
- **[`functions/README.md`](functions/README.md)** — the Cloudflare Pages Functions backend
  (admin/Live indicator, and the accounts/payments scaffold).

## Roadmap

Highlights, roughly in priority order (the live version is `roadmap.html`):

- **Trustworthy live rate data** — replace the hand-maintained fee/tax estimates with values pulled
  on a schedule from authoritative sources.
- **Validate & harden the beta adapters** against real exports; widen the futures point-value map.
- **Journal feature parity** — setups, R-multiple & risk tracking, MAE/MFE.
- **Accounts + zero-knowledge cross-device sync** — end-to-end-encrypted, so your data moves
  between devices without us ever seeing it.
